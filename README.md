# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è EscapeGameKit

EscapeGameKit is a package, enterely created using Flutter, that helps creating
[escape games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_the_room).

It is better suited for web and desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) but can totally
be used on mobile platforms as well !

## Example

You'll find an example in the [`example`](https://github.com/Skyost/EscapeGameKit/tree/master/example)
directory. It's a little escape game called _ERROR 1980_ that I've created for my students. I've translated
it into english, so that you can try it [here](https://skyost.github.io/EscapeGameKit/game.html).

## Getting started

Everything you need in order to get started with this library is available on the
[wiki](https://github.com/Skyost/EscapeGameKit/wiki).

## Caveats

The plugin is currently in beta. Here's the list of things we (me, and hopefully any contributor üòÄ)
need to work on before release :

* [ ] **Better support of hot reload**. Currently, escape games doesn't support hot reload.
* [ ] **Better support of Android and iOS platforms**.
  The plugin is still untested on these platforms, but it should perfectly work. The only problem
  we may encounter is with tooltips.
* [ ] **Add fullscreen / custom window size support**. It should be possible using
  [`Transform.scale`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Transform/Transform.scale.html) or
  something like that.
